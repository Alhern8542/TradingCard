			<p>Chameleons come in a number of shapes, sizes, and colors. They have crests or horns on the backs of their skulls, long, sticky tongues, and uniquely-shaped feet. Many chameleon species also have a prehensile tail, which can be wrapped around branches to aid them in climbing. The scales of many species can change color to green, gray, yellow, red, purple, blue, and more.</p>
